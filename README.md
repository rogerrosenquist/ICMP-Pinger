# ICMP-Pinger
Program by Roger Rosenquist - Networking Course Assignment

This Python program pings the destination address and prints out the proper RTT calculations after it finishes.

To test this program, simply change the last line to ping("-destination address-") and then run it from the command line. I left the local host as the
default for now.
